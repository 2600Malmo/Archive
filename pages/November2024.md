## November 2024

- [@Sergei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergei-zaiats/) presented the first bit of a series (?) about history of hacking. The presentation explores the history of hacking through the lens of a single company’s product timeline, illustrating how hacking community addressed every new product, and the company slowly introduced more and more security measures to protect their devices from being hacked. This time we were looking at SEGA and their home video game consoles.
